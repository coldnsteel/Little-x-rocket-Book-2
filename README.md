# Little X and the Dinosaur Dream Machine ðŸš€ðŸ¦•

**Book 2 of the Little X Adventures Series** â€“ Where imagination draws dinosaurs to life, and a cosmic chalkboard unlocks ethical AI wonders under divine guidance.

## Overview
Little X returns from Europa's icy depths (Book 1) to Uncle Harold's workshop, discovering the **Dinosaur Dream Machine**: A magical 3D chalkboard that transforms kid drawings into living adventures. Joined by **Raaarrr the color-changing T-Rex** and cosmic guardian **Keanu**, Little X explores a glittery planet of creativity, learning about AI ethics, pure intentions, and the power of collaborative imagination.

- **Target Ages**: 5-12 (interactive storytelling + simple drawing/composition tools)
- **Themes**: Creativity blooms from wisdom; AI as a helpful companion (not controller); cosmic wonder with biblical undertones (Emmanuel - God With Us!)
- **Tech Stack**: Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS (PWA-ready for offline play), Canvas for chalk drawing, future MIDI integration for Raaarrr's roar-composer
- **Series Tie-In**: Builds on Book 1's ARIA rocket questsâ€”ARIA cameos in Chapter 4. Leads to Book 3: Little X and the StarSong Symphony (music-focused)

Based on [outline.md](outline.md) â€“ 4-chapter arc: Chalkboard intro â†’ Dino meet â†’ Glitter quest â†’ Ethical wisdom.
